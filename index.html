            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook
            and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
            have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the
            universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
            force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform
            from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron
            out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
            diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double
            box around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
            the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as
            inflation, looked right.

              — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
              smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr.
              Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr.
              Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to
              the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
              itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
              speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
              light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
              infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
              unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
              other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </p>
            <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
            <p>
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
              forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
              gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
              should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not
              part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram
              encoded in gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for
              Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a
              scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
              papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

            Dr. Guth, now 67,pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a
            definite confirmation in his lifetime.

            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations
            and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts
            of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night
            in 1979), in his office last week.

          <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

          <p>
            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we
            did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
            it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
            hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he
            said.

          <p>
            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen
            and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.

          <p>
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays

            Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for
            confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
            temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck
            satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
          </p>
          <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
          <p>
            Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
            findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from
            balloons, mountaintops and space.

          <p><strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong></p>
          <p>
            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves,
            which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50
            years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of
            four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio
            telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing
            conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of
            the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr.
            Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been
            hooked ever since,” he said.

            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
            polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in+- one direction
            rather than another.
          </p>

          <p>
            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
            inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as
            they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said.
            As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in
            spirals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
            temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant
            superconducting thermometer.
          </p>

          <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>

          <p>
            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up
            time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that
            competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
          </p>

          <p><strong>A Special Time</strong></p>

          <p>
            The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying
            up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the
            evolution of the universe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism,
            and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply
            different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its
            earliest, hottest moments.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
            old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics
            evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
          </p>

          <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>

          <p>
            Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls
            below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze,
            releasing latent heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that
            case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of
            antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying
            the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart .
          </p>

          <p>
            What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
            trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
            grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
          </p>

          <p>
            Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
            radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
            universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that
            there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might
            be the ultimate free lunch.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s
            original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own
            universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will
            continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
            multiverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
            going any deeper into the past. 0
          </p>
          <p>
            We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
            inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the
            primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer
            who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
